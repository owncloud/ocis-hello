In order to use the Hello extension we need to configure and start oCIS first. After that we can run the Hello extension itself.

## Configure and start oCIS
You can either [start oCIS from a binary](https://owncloud.dev/ocis/getting-started/#binaries) or [build it from source](https://owncloud.dev/ocis/development/build/#build-the-ocis-binary).

No matter which way you choose, we need to create a configuration file for ownCloud Web, so that the Hello extension will be loaded in the frontend. Therefore create a file `web-config.json` with the following contents:
```json
{
  "server": "https://localhost:9200",
  "theme": "https://localhost:9200/themes/owncloud/theme.json",
  "openIdConnect": {
    "metadata_url": "https://localhost:9200/.well-known/openid-configuration",
    "authority": "https://localhost:9200",
    "client_id": "web",
    "response_type": "code",
    "scope": "openid profile email"
  },
  "apps": [
    "files",
    "preview",
    "pdf-viewer",
    "search",
    "text-editor",
    "draw-io",
    "external",
    "admin-settings"
  ],
  "external_apps": [
    {
      "id": "hello",
      "path": "/hello.js"
    }
  ],
  "options": {
    "previewFileMimeTypes": [
      "image/gif",
      "image/png",
      "image/jpeg",
      "text/plain",
      "image/tiff",
      "image/bmp",
      "image/x-ms-bmp"
    ],
    "upload": {
      "xhr": {
        "timeout": 60000
      }
    },
    "contextHelpersReadMore": true
  }
}
```

Please note the the regististration of our Hello extension in the `external_apps` section. It will trigger ownCloud Web to load `hello.js`, the frontend bundle generated in the [frontend build step]({{< ref "./building#frontend">}}).

To activate the config file we just created we need to set this variable with the path to it.
```
export WEB_UI_CONFIG=<path to web-config.json>
```

The frontend bundle will be requested from the oCIS proxy and requests to our Hello extension's API will also be passed to the oCIS proxy first. Therefore the oCIS proxy needs to be configured to forward these requests to our Hello extension.
In the ocis config folder create a file called `proxy.yaml` with this content:

```yaml

- name: ocis

{{< hint warning >}}
These routes are the default routes of the proxy plus extra routes for the hello extension.
For details see the [proxy documentation](https://owncloud.dev/services/proxy).
{{< /hint >}}

In addition to all these we need to make sure the hello service can be registered to oCIS, for that set this variable.
```
export MICRO_REGISTRY=mdns
```
And finally start the oCIS server:
```
ocis server
```

## Start the extension

After oCIS is running, we can start the Hello extension.

For that just build ocis-hello binary.
```
cd ocis-hello
make build
```

Then set the variables, so that the Hello extension can contact and authenticate to ocis.
First we need the user id of the admin user, that id can be found in the `ocis.yaml` file (e.g `admin_user_id: a92daa31-bddf-4dfd-9a3f-6b3289309107`)
```
export HELLO_ADMIN_USER_ID='<id of the admin user of ocis>'
```

Second we need to set the same JWT secret as is used by ocis. If oCIS was started without any special configurations this value will be also found in the `ocis.yaml` file (e.g. `  jwt_secret: hlFNZU=r!FRduN5hVh$d32SKakf9P3j1`)
```
export HELLO_JWT_SECRET='<jwt secret>'
```

Third the Hello extension needs to be configured to use the same registry as oCIS:
```
export MICRO_REGISTRY=mdns
```

Finally we can run the service
```
./bin/hello server
```
