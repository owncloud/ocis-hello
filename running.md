In order to use the Hello extension we need to configure and start oCIS first. After that we can run the Hello extension itself.

## Configure and start oCIS
You can either [start oCIS from a binary](https://owncloud.dev/ocis/getting-started/#binaries) or [build it from source](https://owncloud.dev/ocis/development/build/#build-the-ocis-binary).

No matter which way you choose, we need to create a configuration file for ownCloud Web, so that the Hello extension will be loaded in the frontend. Therefore create a file `web-config.json` with the following contents:
```json
{
  "server": "https://localhost:9200",
  "theme": "owncloud",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "openIdConnect": {
    "metadata_url": "https://localhost:9200/.well-known/openid-configuration",
    "authority": "https://localhost:9200",
    "client_id": "web",
    "response_type": "code",
    "scope": "openid profile email"
  },
  "apps": ["files", "media-viewer"],
  "external_apps": [
    {
      "id": "settings",
      "path": "/settings.js"
    },
    {
      "id": "accounts",
      "path": "/accounts.js"
    },
    {
      "id": "hello",
      "path": "/hello.js"
    }
  ],
  "options": {
    "hideSearchBar": true
  }
}

```

Please note the the regististration of our Hello extension in the `external_apps` section. It will trigger ownCloud Web to load `hello.js`, the frontend bundle generated in the [frontend build step]({{< ref "./building#frontend">}}).

The frontend bundle will be requested from the oCIS proxy and requests to our Hello extension's API will also be passed to the oCIS proxy first. Therefore the oCIS proxy needs to be configured to forward these requests to our Hello extension.
We do this by using the existing `proxy-example.json` file from the [oCIS proxy](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/blob/master/proxy/config/proxy-example.json). Just add an extra endpoint at the end for the Hello extension.

```json
{
  "endpoint": "/api/v0/greet",
  "backend": "http://localhost:9105"
},
{
  "endpoint": "/hello.js",
  "backend": "http://localhost:9105"
}
```

In addition to all these we will also need to activate the config files we just created. Therefore set these two variables with the path to the respective config file.
```
export WEB_UI_CONFIG=<path to web-config.json>
export PROXY_CONFIG_FILE=<path to ocis proxy config file>
```
And finally start the oCIS server:
```
ocis server
```

## Start the extension

After oCIS is running, we can start the Hello extension.

For that just build ocis-hello binary.
```
cd ocis-hello
make
```
And Run the service
```
./bin/hello server
```
